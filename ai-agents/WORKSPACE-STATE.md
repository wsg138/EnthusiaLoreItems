## WP-04 completed acceptance evidence
- Deterministic SQLite failure-injection/restart coverage exists for direct/API delivery crash boundaries, with fixed-seed stateful recovery coverage guarding no duplicate physical side effects after ambiguous or terminal outcomes.
- Historical schema V1 through V7 upgrade through the production migration runner is verified with identity/audit/pending/deleted-marker/campaign preservation, integrity/foreign-key checks, WAL/busy-timeout expectations, required indexes, interrupted migration rollback, and retry.
- Required queue/executor/cache/debounce/backlog surfaces have deterministic bounded-capacity, saturation, rejection/defer, and recovery coverage; natural-access debounce is production-wired and size-capped.
- Reload/shutdown lifecycle guards are automated: bounded lifecycle queue, stopping/unavailable service state, service unregister, pending-reload failure, runtime drain, executor shutdown, and atomic configuration replacement.
- Public Bukkit service V1 binary/source shape is pinned, implementation behavior is tested, and public API/operator documentation is present.
- The fixed profile covers 100 online players, 25,000 tracked instances, 5,000 loaded container/display scopes, 10,000 pending mixed mutations, 10 campaigns with 2,000 recipients each, and 100 simultaneous administrative queries. Its committed/released profile passed all configured queue and main-thread thresholds.
- Static analysis and complexity gates pass without broad suppression on the final package head.
- RC packaging produces version `1.0.0-rc.1`, shaded JAR, CycloneDX JSON SBOM, dependency manifest, SHA-256 checksum, normalized entry manifest, raw test reports, profile evidence, and release notes; two clean builds matched by full JAR checksum and normalized contents.
- Operator installation/upgrade/configuration/backup/restore/rollback/degraded recovery/incident guidance is complete at `docs/operator-guide.md`.
- Executable WP-05 manual acceptance cases and evidence requirements are complete at `docs/wp-05-manual-acceptance-matrix.md`.

## Verification and release record
- Final WP-04 PR head `063ad63ee7341cc42a4f20c51883d5c34abd25a7`: Actions run `31204122398` completed `success`, including Gradle verification, repository tooling, new-code complexity, exact-head Codacy, deterministic profile, RC validation, immutable evidence packaging, and reproducibility. CodeRabbit status was `success`; PR #15 had zero review threads and no requested changes.
- PR #15 was normally merged as `89399db2d92fd7197479a8803e920c02f5bec490`.
- Post-merge `main` CI run `31204427939` completed `success` on that exact implementation merge.
- Initial release workflow validated the exact CI bundle and created `v1.0.0-rc.1` at `89399db2d92fd7197479a8803e920c02f5bec490`, but release creation hit immediate tag-visibility lag.
- Recovery PR #16 head `c0be8bf9755e7038f6a8a9f1feb715322136f3a4`: Actions run `31204825737` completed `success`, including exact-head Codacy; CodeRabbit was `success` and review threads were zero.
- PR #16 was normally merged as `e4b7968adea1357e7307815a5a5ef7f456f16ad1`; post-merge CI run `31205231097` completed `success`.
- Release workflow run `31205326905` completed `success`, detected the existing exact tag, verified it remained on `main`, selected the successful CI run for the tagged SHA, revalidated the immutable artifact bundle, and published without moving the tag or executing repository code.
- GitHub release `v1.0.0-rc.1` is `prerelease: true` and has `target_commitish` `89399db2d92fd7197479a8803e920c02f5bec490`.
- Verified assets: `EnthusiaLoreItems.jar`, `EnthusiaLoreItems.jar.sha256`, `bom.cyclonedx.json`, `gradle-dependencies.txt`, `normalized-entry-manifest.txt`, `wp04-profile.json`, `EnthusiaLoreItems-test-reports.tar.gz`.
- Released JAR digest: `sha256:3c7b6aa74ee63a4e049c5e09f2bebffe78bf50ea88caaaa3d03b55e941f427c8`.

## WP-05 completed acceptance criteria
None. Package routing, claim, RC metadata verification, and external-dependency verification do not count as manual live acceptance.

## WP-05 remaining acceptance criteria
- Execute every manual case in `docs/wp-05-manual-acceptance-matrix.md` against the exact RC with complete GitHub-backed evidence.
- Fix and regression-test every confirmed defect in this same package.
- Repeat the entire matrix against the exact final WP-05 JAR with every case PASS.
- Re-run full automated WP-04 CI/profile/migration/package/static-analysis gates on the final head.
- Complete independent code review and separate evidence audit with no requested changes or unresolved threads.
- Record owner/operator sign-off.
- Finalize `1.0.0`, merge normally, verify live `main`, publish `v1.0.0`, and verify tag target/assets/checksums.

## Tests and verification
- Pre-claim live `main` `476f9e5bbfa8155ab76b23bde0681ac35b92f177`: CI run `31215810485` successful; Release RC run `31215904779` successful.
- GitHub prerelease `v1.0.0-rc.1` directly verified with target `89399db2d92fd7197479a8803e920c02f5bec490` and JAR digest `sha256:3c7b6aa74ee63a4e049c5e09f2bebffe78bf50ea88caaaa3d03b55e941f427c8`.
- PR #18/head `5825c2ddc284300ec323a47d5d62b6bb9a8ac853` started Actions CI run `31216625563`; it was still in progress when the external blocker was confirmed and is superseded by later blocker/review-remediation commits.
- No WP-05 manual case is claimed as run or PASS.
- No local build result is claimed because this execution environment cannot reach GitHub for a dependency-capable checkout.

## Known findings
- No competing unfinished canonical package lock exists.
- No committed WP-05 executed-case evidence or WP-05 live-acceptance issue was found during repository reconciliation.
- Harsh review of the first blocker checkpoint found unnecessary deletion/condensation of already-verified WP-04 history from state files; the review-remediation commit restores that durable evidence without changing WP-05 status or acceptance claims.

## External blocker
WP-05 requires a designated Java 21 Paper/Leaf 1.21.11-compatible live acceptance server with Geyser/Floodgate and Java, Bedrock, offline, and never-joined test accounts. The available runtime exposes no remote-server/SSH/deployment tool, the repository contains no server-access handoff, repository/issue search contains no executed WP-05 matrix evidence, and plugin discovery found no matching installable remote-server connector. The physical, restart, Bedrock, backup/restore, rollback, saturation, and player-interaction cases therefore cannot be executed or honestly marked PASS from this worker.

## Resume condition
Make the designated acceptance environment and required test accounts operable by this worker, or commit durable exact-RC executed-case evidence that can be independently audited. Resume the same canonical branch and draft PR #18; do not create a new package or subdivision.

## Exact next action
When the external dependency is available, re-reconcile live GitHub and PR #18, verify the exact RC digest again, execute `ACC-ENV-001`, commit its full evidence, and continue WP-05 only. Do not begin WP-06.
