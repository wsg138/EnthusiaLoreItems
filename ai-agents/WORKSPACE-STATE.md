## WP-04 completed acceptance evidence
- Deterministic SQLite failure-injection/restart coverage exists for direct/API delivery crash boundaries, with fixed-seed stateful recovery coverage guarding no duplicate physical side effects after ambiguous or terminal outcomes.
- Historical schema V1 through V7 upgrade through the production migration runner is verified with identity/audit/pending/deleted-marker/campaign preservation, integrity/foreign-key checks, WAL/busy-timeout expectations, required indexes, interrupted migration rollback, and retry.
- Required queue/executor/cache/debounce/backlog surfaces have deterministic bounded-capacity, saturation, rejection/defer, and recovery coverage; natural-access debounce is production-wired and size-capped.
- Reload/shutdown lifecycle guards are automated: bounded lifecycle queue, stopping/unavailable service state, service unregister, pending-reload failure, runtime drain, executor shutdown, and atomic configuration replacement.
- Public Bukkit service V1 binary/source shape is pinned, implementation behavior is tested, and public API/operator documentation is present.
- The fixed profile covers 100 online players, 25,000 tracked instances, 5,000 loaded container/display scopes, 10,000 pending mixed mutations, 10 campaigns with 2,000 recipients each, and 100 simultaneous administrative queries. Its committed/released profile passed all configured queue and main-thread thresholds.
- Static analysis and complexity gates pass without broad suppression on the final package head.
- RC packaging produces version `1.0.0-rc.1`, shaded JAR, CycloneDX JSON SBOM, dependency manifest, SHA-256 checksum, normalized entry manifest, raw test reports, profile evidence, and release notes; two clean builds matched by full JAR checksum and normalized contents.
- Operator installation/upgrade/configuration/backup/restore/rollback/degraded recovery/incident guidance is complete at `docs/operator-guide.md`.
- Executable WP-05 manual acceptance cases and evidence requirements are complete at `docs/wp-05-manual-acceptance-matrix.md`.

## Verification and release record
- Final WP-04 PR head `063ad63ee7341cc42a4f20c51883d5c34abd25a7`: Actions run `31204122398` completed `success`, including Gradle verification, repository tooling, new-code complexity, exact-head Codacy, deterministic profile, RC validation, immutable evidence packaging, and reproducibility. CodeRabbit status was `success`; PR #15 had zero review threads and no requested changes.
- PR #15 was normally merged as `89399db2d92fd7197479a8803e920c02f5bec490`.
- Post-merge `main` CI run `31204427939` completed `success` on that exact implementation merge.
- Initial release workflow validated the exact CI bundle and created `v1.0.0-rc.1` at `89399db2d92fd7197479a8803e920c02f5bec490`, but release creation hit immediate tag-visibility lag.
- Recovery PR #16 head `c0be8bf9755e7038f6a8a9f1feb715322136f3a4`: Actions run `31204825737` completed `success`, including exact-head Codacy; CodeRabbit was `success` and review threads were zero.
- PR #16 was normally merged as `e4b7968adea1357e7307815a5a5ef7f456f16ad1`; post-merge CI run `31205231097` completed `success`.
- Release workflow run `31205326905` completed `success`, detected the existing exact tag, verified it remained on `main`, selected the successful CI run for the tagged SHA, revalidated the immutable artifact bundle, and published without moving the tag or executing repository code.
- GitHub release `v1.0.0-rc.1` is `prerelease: true` and has `target_commitish` `89399db2d92fd7197479a8803e920c02f5bec490`.
- Verified assets: `EnthusiaLoreItems.jar`, `EnthusiaLoreItems.jar.sha256`, `bom.cyclonedx.json`, `gradle-dependencies.txt`, `normalized-entry-manifest.txt`, `wp04-profile.json`, `EnthusiaLoreItems-test-reports.tar.gz`.
- Released JAR digest: `sha256:3c7b6aa74ee63a4e049c5e09f2bebffe78bf50ea88caaaa3d03b55e941f427c8`.

## Known findings
- No unresolved WP-04 review thread or requested change remains.
- No confirmed production item-loss/duplication defect remains open from WP-04 automated verification.
- The RC publisher contains a safe partial-publication recovery path and becomes a no-op once the RC release already exists.
- No live Paper/Leaf acceptance is claimed here; WP-05 owns live behavior verification and production-release decision.

## Blocker
None for WP-05. WP-06 remains blocked.

## Exact next action
Start WP-05 from the live `main` head after this state transition is merged. Test the exact released `v1.0.0-rc.1` JAR using `docs/wp-05-manual-acceptance-matrix.md`, preserve the required evidence per case, and do not start WP-06 until WP-05 reaches its production-release gate.
